      <h3>Design and Development</h3>
      <p>During this lockdown period, I have started learning the online course which is going to develop Web Developer skills.
        As I know that, Programming is a career that is a lot more interesting than a lot of alternatives out. So let's learn together and grow together.</p>

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I'm not a professional photographer but I want to be a professional.
        I believe in "The picture that you took with your camera is the imagination you want to create with reality"and I want to say
        "Taking an image, freezing a moment, reveals how rich reality truly is".</p>

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>In this lockdown 2020 everyone is doing something that gives pleasure to them.
        In the same way, I'm improving my hobbies too, like playing the piano!! because I believe that "Without music, life would be a mistake". </p>
